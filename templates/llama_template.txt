    Example question: What movement did the arrest of Jack Weinberg in Sproul Plaza give rise to?
    Example answer: To answer the question, we need to identify the movement that was sparked by the arrest of Jack Weinberg in Sproul Plaza. 
    The context provided gives us the necessary information to determine this.

    prompted a series of student-led acts of formal remonstrance and civil disobedience that ultimately gave rise to the Free Speech Movement##end_quote##.
    From this sentence, we understand that the arrest of Jack Weinberg led to student-led acts which then gave rise to a specific movement. 
    The name of the movement is explicitly mentioned in the same sentence as the "Free Speech Movement."
    Therefore, based on the context provided, we can conclude that the arrest of Jack Weinberg in Sproul Plaza gave rise to the Free Speech Movement.
