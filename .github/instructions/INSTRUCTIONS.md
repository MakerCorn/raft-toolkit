## Project Maintenance Instructions

### Always Update the Changelog

After making any changes to the project (including bug fixes, new features, or documentation updates), **always update the `CHANGELOG.md` file** to reflect your modifications.
Include a brief description of the change, the date, and your name or GitHub handle if appropriate.

This helps keep the project history clear and makes it easier for others to track progress.

## Coding Standards

## Quality Checking
