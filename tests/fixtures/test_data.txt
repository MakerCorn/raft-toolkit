This is a sample text document for testing the RAFT toolkit.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to test chunking functionality.
Each paragraph should be processed separately to generate questions and answers.

This paragraph discusses the importance of retrieval-augmented fine-tuning.
RAFT combines the benefits of retrieval systems with fine-tuned language models.

The final paragraph explains how RAFT works in practice.
Documents are chunked, questions are generated, and models are trained on the resulting dataset.
